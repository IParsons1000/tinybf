tinybf - a very small brainf*ck interpreter

Description
-----------

tinybf is a very small brainf*ck interpreter written in x86_64 assembly for
Linux.

Installation
------------

Build with:

```bash
make all
```

Optionally, you may test the build with:

```bash
make test
```

tinybf is a standalone binary.  You can copy it where you want it by hand, or
install it in /bin with:

```bash
make install
```

NOTE: This program uses only Linux 64-bit system calls.  In theory, it should
work on all systems, but I have only tested it on:
 - Fedora 40

It should be buildable on other POSIX-compliant x86-64 systems with only
modifications to the syscall numbers.

Recommended build tools: NASM, GNU ld, GNU make

Usage
-----

tinybf takes a brainf*ck source file supplied in the command line:

```shell
tinybf example.bf
```

Credit
------

The Brainf*ck programming language was originally created by Urban Mueller in
1993.  See `CREDITS' in the test submodule for test program credits.
